I am a rising third year PhD student at the University of Washington in the Department of Atmospheric and Climate Science. I am co-advised by Dr. Qiang Fu and Dr. L. Ruby Leung at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and I work on research questions broadly related to the hydroclimate and mesoscale convective systems.
