I am a rising third year PhD student at the University of Washington in the Department of Atmospheric and Climate Science. I am co-advised by  [Dr. Qiang Fu](https://atmos.washington.edu/~qfu/) and [Dr. L. Ruby Leung](https://www.pnnl.gov/people/lai-yung-ruby-leung) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and I work on research questions broadly related to the hydroclimate and mesoscale convective systems.
